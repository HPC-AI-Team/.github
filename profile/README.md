Welcome to the HPC+AI team.


The HPC+AI team


The HPC+AI Research Group is led by Professor Weile Jia at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We focus on the intersection of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to advance scientific discovery and computational research.

🎯 Research Focus

Our research spans several interconnected areas at the cutting edge of computational research:

•   AI for Science (AI4S): Developing and applying artificial intelligence methods/models for domain scientists to solve complex problems in physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and other scientific domains.

•   Large Language Models (LLMs): Research on foundational LLM training, efficient fine-tuning, inference acceleration, and their applications in scientific contexts such as literature mining, code generation, and knowledge discovery.

•   High-Performance Computing (HPC): Specializing in parallel algorithms, performance optimization, and scalability of large-scale scientific computing applications and AI models on modern heterogeneous supercomputing architectures.

•   First-Principles Calculations: Utilizing and developing ab-initio quantum mechanical simulation methods to achieve high-accuracy material and molecular modeling.

🚀 Mission

Our primary mission is to leverage the power of modern supercomputing infrastructure to push the boundaries of scientific research. We aim to:

•   Advance Scientific Research: Provide advanced computational tools and solutions to address grand challenges in key areas like energy, environment, and health.

•   Overcome Computational Limits: Break through traditional barriers in simulation scale, time, and accuracy via algorithmic innovation and extreme performance optimization.

•   Pioneer the HPC+AI Paradigm: Deeply integrate high-performance computing with artificial intelligence to create new pathways for scientific exploration, with a particular focus on interdisciplinary areas emerging in the AI era.
